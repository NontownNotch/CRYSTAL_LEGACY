# Nontown_Studio_DIE_Game
The game is a time-turn based JRPG game.

The combat system involves the ATB (Action Time Battle), which is based on the system of FINAL FANTASY VI and FINAL FANTASY XIII.\
Both the characters and the enimies have the HP value, the MP value and the ATB value. The characters have different ATB slots while the value can grow with time and different actions (ATTACK, ABILITY, MAGIC) will consume different slots of ATB. MAGIC will also use the MP value. Player can use the ATB to input the next action.

The map and story will be based on traditional JRPG games while the battle and the map will be in different scenes.
